First I'd like to kindly remind you there is a free service available in the 'Free and paid service' subsection of the
ConflictSerializability.html file for those who have time on their side.

In the case it is urgent or that you just want to have priority, the following are the terms of the paid service and rates.

1. The initial fee is 0.1 bitcoin.

2. Upon receiving the initial fee, I will review your application, which should be sent to the following address: creamyfish@gmail.com. 
Please include 'paid service' in the title to have my attention and include a deadline that the application is due. Based on the analysis of 
the application and the deadline, I will give you an estimate about the extra charge if I chose to provide service. If you agree, the service 
will start AFTER the estimate is received. The initial fee is not refundable in any case, even if I chose NOT to provide service, for example 
due to a deadline that is too close.

3. The total charge should be between 0.1 - 2 bitcoins, depending on the complexity of your application. For an application with complexity 
like TPCC as in Example 16, the charge is between 0.1 - 0.2 bitcoin. If you don't follow the guidelines described in the 'Free and paid service' 
subsection of the ConflictSerializability.html file when you send me your application, a few more rounds of communications might result. 
You might got additional charges for that if things got out of hand.

4. Please allow an 24-hours response time for your first contact since we may not be on the same continent.

5. If your application is interesting to me, you will receive a handsome discount(up to 50%).

6. The charge is on a per service basis. If you only make minor changes to your application after a previous service, you may skip the
initial fee for a subsequent service.

7. Bitcoin price fluctuates a lot, I will adjust these charges if it is out of control.

8. I have final say about non-mathematical terms like 'interesting' and 'minor changes'.

Please make the payment through Electrum to the following address: bc1qyte694acfgqxpy7zuv0xte5fs9ed2ty2226nnq. At the same time,
please send an e-mail to creamyfish@gmail.com to notify me this payment(might send in your application as well). I will start evaluate
your application once the payment goes through.
